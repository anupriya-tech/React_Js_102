Question 1	:
				var a = 21;

				var b = function(){
				console.log(a);
				 var a = 20;
				};
				
				b(); 
			
Output		:	undefined
				
Description	:	variable a inside the function scope is used before its been declared that is why the value of a is undefined.






Question 2	:
				const magic = 42;
				const theAnswer = magic;
				const everything = new Set([magic,theAnswer]);
				console.log(everything.size);
			
Output		:	1
				
Description	:	Because each value in the Set has to be unique. 






Question 3	:
				let x = 10;
				let y = x % 4;
				let z = y / 2;
				let c = x * z;
				alert(x); 
			
Output		:	10
				
Description	:	The value of x is not changed once its declared.






Question 4	:
				//Default function declaration
				function rectangle(w, h){
				  return w * h;
				}

				//Function Expression
				const rectangle = function (w,h){
				  return w * h;
				}

				//Function Arrow Expression
				const rectangle = (w, h) => {
				  return w * h;
				}

				//Shorthand Arrow Function
				 const rectangle = (w, h) =>  w * h;

				console.log(rectangle(10,10));
				
				
Output		:	SyntaxError: Identifier 'rectangle' has already been declared
				
Description	:	Question 4 doesnt seems like a question.. and it is actually the syntax for the different functions. 
				Default function declaration, Function Expression, Function Arrow Expression, Shorthand Arrow Function.
				Even if we run this program, we get the error SyntaxError: Identifier 'rectangle' has already been declared
				as the value of constant cant be changed.
