1. function aaa() {
    return
      {
        test: 1
      };
    }
    
alert(typeof aaa());

Ans:"undefined"
Explanation : we are Returning object inside of function,But we have line break after rerurn that's y we getting output undefined.


2. document.getElementById("title"); 
    [or]
    $("#title");  

    Ans:"document.getelementbyid" is faster than jquery $("#title");

3. const int = 26;
const hex = 0x1A;
const octal = 0o32;
const binary = 0b11010;

(0b11010 | 0b00001) == 0b11011

Ans:"true"

Explanation: 0x1A is 26 in hex
0o32 is 26 in octal
0b11010 is 26 in binary

when we perform or operation  (0b11010 | 0b00001) => 0b11011 == 0b11011 as both are same ans is true.


4.(10).toString()

  (10).toString(2)

Ans:(10).toString() method returns "10" as string value i,e. typeof(10) is string
(10).toString(2) returns "binary value" of "10".
The "tostring" method converts value into string type by default.
if we  pass radix from 2-36 converts the the number based on radix. 


5.const times = ["Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening"];
times.map(t => 'Good ${t}!').forEach(s => console.log(s));

Ans:Good ${t}!
Good ${t}!
Good ${t}!

Explanation:Here frist map function returns a new array with the results excuted by function on each element,
For each loop will run the function on each element.
So in map function we are returning  "Good ${t}" three times as we 3 array elements,
and printing each "Good ${t}!" in for each loop using console.log


6)const apple = 3;
   const basket ={
      apple: 2,
      bag: {
          apple: 1,
          plastic: function(){
              return this.apple;
          }
      }
   }

 const plastic = basket.bag.plastic;
 console.log(plastic());
 onsole.log(basket.bag.plastic());

 Ans:"undefined"
      "1"
 Explanation: i think we are storing a function in varible so that this.apple is not avilable that's y we are getiing "undefined".
  console.log(basket.bag.plastic()); Here we are calling function of oject so apple will be avilable 
  and the current value is 1,so this.apple is "1"
