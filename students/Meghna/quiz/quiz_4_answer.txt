what is the difference between Spread Operator and Rest operator?

Ans:
Spread Operator: Spread Operator when used with object or array it will return copy of the object.
it is also used to concate arrays and objects.
ex:let arr1 = [10,20]
let arr2 = [30,40]

arr1 = [...arr1,arr2] 
Here arr1 is appended with array 2 at the end.

Rest Operator:Rest operator is used when destructuring,assigns all remaning elements to the variables.

ex:let [a,b,...c] = [10,20,30,40]
//here it will assign 30,40 as array to c

let arr = [10,20,30]
let [e,...g] = arr
//here it will assign e = 10,all remaning to g


Difference Between Shallow Copy and Deep Copy?

A shallow copy means constructing a new collection object and 
then populating it with references to the child objects found in the original. In essence, 
a shallow copy is only one level deep. 
The copying process does not recurse and therefore wonâ€™t create copies of the child objects themselves.

A deep copy makes the copying process recursive. 
It means first constructing a new collection object and then recursively populating it with copies of the child objects found in the original. 
Copying an object this way walks the whole object tree to create a fully independent clone of the original object and all of its children.


what is prototype?in es5 nd es6
Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another. 

All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.

function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
}

const myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");

//Here myFather will inherit from person class prototype.

prototype property also allows you to add new methods to objects constructors
