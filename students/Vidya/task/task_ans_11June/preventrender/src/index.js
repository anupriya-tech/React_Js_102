      <h1>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam <sub>(15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015)</sub> </h1>
        He was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.<br/>
        He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering.<br/>
        He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)<br/> and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.<br/>
        He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.<br/>
        He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, <br/>the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.<br/>
        Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress.<br/>
        Widely referred to as the "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, <br/> including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.</p>
