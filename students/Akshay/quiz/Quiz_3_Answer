Que-1)  function aaa() {

    return
      {

        test: 1
    
      };

    }
    
alert(typeof aaa());

    Answer:undefined 
    
    function aaa is invoked and seems to return an object. But JS is sly and likes to help out by inserting semicolons where you may have missed them.
    When JS inserts semi-colons 
    
    function aaa() {
    return;
    {
        test: 1
    };
}
alert(typeof aaa());
