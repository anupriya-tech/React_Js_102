Question 1:
let x = 10;
				let y = x % 4;
				let z = y / 2;
				let c = x * z;
				alert(x);

Output: 10 
Description: redeclaring of a variablce with let is not allowed.

Question 2:
var a = 21;

				var b = function(){
        console.log(a);
				var a = 20;
				};
				
				b();

Output : undefined  
Description: In the block scope, console.log(a), 'a' is used and then a is initialized(var a=20). 
But in javascript declared variable(var a;) is hoisted at top but not initialized variable. So it returns undefined.


Question 3: 
				const magic = 42;
				const theAnswer = magic;
				const everything = new Set([magic,theAnswer]);
				console.log(everything.size);
Output: 1
Description: Only 1 value is stored in set object(set[42,42] which is not allowed) because Set object holds unique values.

Question 4: 
			//Default function declaration
function rectangle(w, h){
  return w * h;
}

//Function Expression
const rectangle = function (w,h){
  return w * h;
}

//Function Arrow Expression
const rectangle = (w, h) => {
  return w * h;
}

//Shorthand Arrow Function
 const rectangle = (w, h) =>  w * h;

Output: SyntaxError: Identifier 'rectangle' has already been declared 
Description: identifier recatangle is already been declared as function 
and it can't be redeclared as const type again.
