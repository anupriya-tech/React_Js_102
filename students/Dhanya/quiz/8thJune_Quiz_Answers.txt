1) Javascript quiz - 3
var a = 21;
var b = function(){
    console.log(a);
    var a = 20;
};

b();
answer : Output will be undefined since the variable a is not being assigned value before printing on the console.

2)//Javascript quiz - 2
let x = 10;
let y = x % 4;
let z = y / 2;
let c = x * z;

alert(x);
answer: alert() is not defined will be displayed as output since alert() is a window object and not Javascript inbuilt function.

3) const magic = 42;
const theAnswer = magic;
const everything = new Set([magic, theAnswer]);
console.log(everything.size);

answer: output will be shown as 1 since the Set() constructor considers only unique values and both variables magic and theAnswer contains same value 42.

4)//default function declaration
function rectangle(w, h){
    return w * h;
}

//function expression
const rectangle = function(w, h){
    return w * h;
}

//function Arrow expression
const rectangle = (w, h) => {
    return w * h;
}

//shorthand arrow function
const rectangle = (w, h) => w * h;

answer: Output will be shown as "rectangle has alreadt been declared" since Line 7 i.e  function expression as well redefines function rectangle itself.
