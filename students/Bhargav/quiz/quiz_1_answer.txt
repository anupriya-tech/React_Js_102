Q1. var a = 21;

    Var b = function() {

    console.log(a);

    var a = 20; 
    };

    b();

ans. the output is undefined Because Variable a is being used before it is declared And the value
     of 'a' is undefined. var a =21; is not a global variable so it cannot access in the method  

Q2.     const magic = 42; 
	const theAnswer = magic;
	const everything = new Set([magic,theAnswer]); 
	console.log(everything.size);

ans. Creating a variable magic and assigning  the value to the answer.
     Now with set we are adding both values are one array.so the size of it is 1

Q3.             let x = 10;
		let y = x % 4;
		let z = y / 2;
		let c = x * z;
		alert(x); 

ans.     here the x is using as a different operater but there is no change in 
         the value of x as there are no operation being performed on it so it remains same as 10  

Q4a. function rectangle(w,h) {

          return w*h;



ans: it is default function declaration  with specified parameters  

 4
b. const rectangle = function(w,h){ 

      return w*h 

      }   

ans. It is similar to function declaration with parameters. However the difference 
     is here the function name can be omitted as the variable is defined  
4c.   const rectangle = (w,h) =>{
      return  w*h;
      }
ans       

4d.  const rectangle =(w,h)=>w*h;
ans
